# Tamagotchi C++ Game

## Project Description
This project implements a simple Tamagotchi game in C++. Tamagotchi is a virtual pet that you need to take care of, feed, play with, and keep healthy to ensure a happy life.

## Programming Logic

The game uses a procedural approach to organize Tamagotchi's actions and player interactions. Additionally, some of the key implemented logics include:

- **Random Generation:** The random choice of Tamagotchi's gender is implemented using the `rand()` library to generate pseudo-random numbers.
- **Decision Making:** The game uses conditional structures (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to make decisions based on Tamagotchi's current conditions, such as hunger, health, and happiness.
- **Game Loop:** A `while` loop is used to allow the player to interact with Tamagotchi multiple times until choosing to end the game.
